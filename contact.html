        I don't have many projects at the moment. I've completed several small
        projects such as a rock-paper-scissors game, a slot machine using just
        JavaScript, and many others using HTML and CSS too. However, the project
        that helped me obtain my diploma is a todo list, and I'm currently
        waiting for the diploma to be awarded. It has many features like editing
        a task on double-click, changing the position of tasks by dragging them,
        and displaying the time and date of task creation just by hovering over
        them, but I'll let you see more for yourself. Hope you like it.

          Here, I've attempted to create a password generator. I must admit that
          while it's functional, I didn't develop it entirely on my own.
          Meaning, I looked on the internet for a few things I didn't know.
          However, I handled the HTML and CSS parts all alone, and I learned
          some new things while working on the JavaScript portion. Feel free
          take a look.
